## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another look at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching
- [ ] Should .lock and tool-versions be added to .gitignore? I've never committed them
- [ ] Refactor to use Pola.rs
- [-] Write better/more thorough docstrings
- [ ] Look up examples of applying OOP practices to data science
- [ ] Make a PR to update the documentation for how **kwargs are used for sklearn Pipeline (their example and docs are seemingly incorrect)
- [ ] Make a PR to update the FeatureAgglomeration docs to have linkage ward also say "only euclidean is accepted"
- [ ] Make a PR to update FeatureAgglomeration docs: cosine affinity cannot work with sparse matrices
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines to repo
- [ ] Use KMeans to predict cluster for the Missing Cuisine recipes
  - [ ] Move to rawer data (see step below)
- [ ] Run clustering on the untransformed dataframes to see what we get out
- [] Update README
- [] Check speed limiter on Edamam, it may be too restrictive
  - See if there's an error code to diagnose
- [] Would be cool to have something like [this graph](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333311663/figure/fig2/AS:761665331163137@1558606574933/Two-mode-network-graph-of-obsidian-frequencies-from-Period-3-900-BC-300-BC.png)
  - Have interactivity to display the closest recipes to your searched recipe
- [] Link VSCode to the droplet (can use SSH)
- [] How to (check vod from 11.11)
- [] Add [button to copy links in markdown format in MeaLeon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)
- [] Reenable TFIDF instead of the OHE vectors

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
~~- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model~~
- [ ] Corno mode
- [ ] CuwonoZeewo scuffed mode
- [ ] Need a Klawful knife emote, or a shotgun (thanks R4D4R)
- [ ] Install minecraft
- [ ] Update suggested python dev list
  - [ ] Add statquest channel
- [ ] Expensive redeem: crono tells lore from vtuber chat (Requested by maweexy)
- [ ] Add smort command
- [ ] Maweexy wants "Data Da Da", maybe that can be a different mode
  - [ ] Intelijens +1
- [X] Really need to set up a timer for breaks/ads
  - [ ] Or just have fewer ads, Crono
- [ ] Fix me with small screen scene
- [X] Add a raid command that shouts out raiders and links to an intro/MeaLeon
- check out deadmau5 one day
  - LTT x deadmau5
- What were the results of the pun poll?

- For next stream
  - Classify and or cluster the missing labels to see how they can augment existing recipe database
