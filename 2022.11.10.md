## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Crono needs to remember to get his free daily raid pass in PoGo
   2. Hatched Shiny Munchlax
      1. What are its IVs? Don't worry about it
2. Coding
   1. Dev tools
      1. How did Crono deploy on DigitalOcean?
         1. [Spin up an Ubuntu droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-22-04)
         2. Crono did not install ASDF on the Ubuntu droplet. Why? It was very annoying and tedious on the droplet and also, each droplet seems kinda like a microservice because they're not particularly powerful. MeaLeon is running off a 2GB RAM, 25GB storage (the cheapest with 2GB of RAM) droplet and it seems like the intention is to use small droplets that can be easily closed or deleted
            1. Becase of this, I didn't even use a real virtual environment...
         3. [If wanted, you can use venv by following these docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-an-ubuntu-22-04-server)
         4. Did install poetry!
            1. [Need these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-poetry-to-manage-python-dependencies-on-ubuntu-22-04)
            2. [New version of Poetry has a hashing problem, so follow these instructions to get Poetry working correctly](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6301)
         5. [To get Flask up and running](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-22-04)
   2. Variable redeem from Piqcyl: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
3. Derail/from chat
   1. Crono's grad school studies
      1. Thought about contributing to this project/redoing dissertation with [this](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.5.0/tutorial/walkthrough.html)

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another look at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching
- [ ] Should .lock and tool-versions be added to .gitignore? I've never committed them
- [ ] Refactor to use Pola.rs
- [-] Write better/more thorough docstrings
- [ ] Look up examples of applying OOP practices to data science
- [ ] Make a PR to update the documentation for how **kwargs are used for sklearn Pipeline (their example and docs are seemingly incorrect)
- [ ] Make a PR to update the FeatureAgglomeration docs to have linkage ward also say "only euclidean is accepted"
- [ ] Make a PR to update FeatureAgglomeration docs: cosine affinity cannot work with sparse matrices
- [X] Figure out the ideal process for putting a corpus with collection of documents through a sklearn pipeline considering you previously got the overall counts and then did TFIDF on the individual recipes using the CV from overall.
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines to repo
- [ ] Use KMeans to predict cluster for the Missing Cuisine recipes
  - [ ] Move to rawer data (see step below)
- [ ] Run clustering on the untransformed dataframes to see what we get out
- [] Update README
- [] Check speed limiter on Edamam, it may be too restrictive
  - See if there's an error code to diagnose
- [] Would be cool to have something like [this graph](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333311663/figure/fig2/AS:761665331163137@1558606574933/Two-mode-network-graph-of-obsidian-frequencies-from-Period-3-900-BC-300-BC.png)
  - Have interactivity to display the closest recipes to your searched recipe
- [] Link VSCode to the droplet (can use SSH)
- [] How to 

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
~~- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model~~
- [ ] Corno mode
- [ ] CuwonoZeewo scuffed mode
- [ ] Need a Klawful knife emote, or a shotgun (thanks R4D4R)
- [ ] Install minecraft
- [ ] Update suggested python dev list
  - [ ] Add statquest channel
- [ ] 2022.10.14 First ever follow bot attack
- [ ] Expensive redeem: crono tells lore from vtuber chat
- [ ] Add smort command
- [ ] Maweexy wants "Data Da Da", maybe that can be a different mode
  - [ ] Intelijens +1
- [ ] !Keyboard command
- [X] Really need to set up a timer for breaks/ads
  - [ ] Or just have fewer ads, Crono

- For next stream
  - Classify and or cluster the missing labels to see how they can augment existing recipe database
- [] 2022.10.31 Raided 4 times!
- [X] Migrate to DigitalOcean already
  - Flask app working in Dev!
  - Would like to make space on BuenosDS.dev/MeaLeon for it to run
- [] Add [button to copy links in markdown format in MeaLeon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)
- [] Add a raid command!
- [] Reenable TFIDF instead of the OHE vectors
- 2022.11.10 stream: six raids!
- check out deadmau5 one day
  - LTT x deadmau5
