      1. Likelihood of driver skill given driver demographics
   3. Data science as sold vs as a job/career
      1. SQL SQL SQL
      2. Maybe some Python and R
      3. Check out Mode and Stratascratch in the [career help page](https://buenosds.dev/helpful-data-science-career-resources/)
   4. Phone talk
      1. I would strongly consider the [Zenfone 9](https://www.gsmarena.com/asus_zenfone_9-review-2455.php), which was just announced
      2. [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) for open source/Linux based phone OS

2. Code
   1. Trying to use multinomial classification instead of One Vs Rest
      1. Ended up going from 3% to 47% which is great, but I remember getting 80% with a logreg before...
   2. Poetry a while ago switched to default to [installing virtual environment packages inside project repo](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/). I have been using this feature without realizing it, and it seems pretty good. [Possible issues](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/108#issuecomment-628796162) are backup size and Docker conflicts
3. Keyboard talk break
   1. Emacs has a [Meta key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_key), and used to have Super and Hyper keys
      1. Purple is learning emacs
