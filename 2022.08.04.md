## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Admin and follow up on yesterday's to dos
2. Coding
   1. Fitting Random Forests
   2. lattjorr asked a cool question: How do I compare two linear regression models? one cuts the amount of variables used by 2/3 but how to explain which is better using this [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113)
      1. Crono's business answer: the model that is easier to explain to the people paying you and/or the one that captures most of the true behavior with less data
         1. [This Quora discussion](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-compare-two-regression-models-against-each-other) is better because there's actual processes
      2. Found a [discussion of F statistic](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/f-statistic-value-test/) that had improper language about p-value meaning and that derailed and talked about the controversy around p-values
         1. How the [American Stastiscal Association feels about p-value misuse](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/p-valuestatement.pdf)
         2. [Older discussion about improper interpretations of p-values](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH717-QuantCore/PH717-Module7-T-tests/Module7-ttests3.html)
         3. Using t tests to [compare sample vs population means](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/statistics-square-one/7-t-tests)
      3. Related to my business focused answer above was a reddit post asking about [what 20% tools people are using to do 80% of their work](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/wfzrdk/using_the_8020_rule_what_top_20_of_your_tools/)
   3. Suggested checking out the subreddits for datascience and statistics
   4. kmode has an exam in a super interesting subject: [Uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification#:~:text=Uncertainty%20quantification%20(UQ)%20is%20the,system%20are%20not%20exactly%20known.)
   5. [Cat struggles to drink water from a faucet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHFohNH0UI)

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] send [Leah](https://www.twitch.tv/LeahTCodes) the [math derivations for decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-mathematical-formulation)
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] Add tree visualization libraries to virtual environment: ETE or Graphviz (which is in sklearn now) or Plotly or treelib (which is the most simple)
- [ ] Sery bot for follow botting protection

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
