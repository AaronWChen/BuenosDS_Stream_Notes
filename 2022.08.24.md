## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Went to Paris to see French architecture, and I got an *Eiffel*
   2. Traffic rant
   3. Office and physical activity...how can I hit my step goals without the treadmill desk
   4. Apple and Multi Stream Transport
      1. It [doesn't work and probably never will](https://sebvance.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-macbook-pros-and-their-lack-of-displayport-mst-multi-stream-98ce33d64af4)
      2. [It has worked on PCs for a long time](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000128707/how-to-daisy-chain-multiple-monitors-using-displayport-multi-stream-transport-mst)
   5. NLP tools
      1. [Explosion.ai's twitter feed](https://twitter.com/explosion_ai)
      2. [Floret, lighter weight word embeddings](https://explosion.ai/blog/floret-vectors)
   6. Ranted on admin costs at UMass Amherst
2. Coding
   1. Tried the joblib dump/load and it works
      1. Actually, ran into a problem where one function wasn't pickled correctly
      2. Likely need to refactor to put in separate script
   2. Scikit learn and ETE may not work well together. ETE asks for data in Newick tree format, but not clear if sklearn supports
      1. Definitely not for an overall RFC
      2. There is scikit-bio which has a [way to depict results in Newick trees](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/generated/skbio.io.format.newick.html)
   3. Trying tSNE via TruncatedSVD
3. Detour
   1. [Origin of Peking Ravioli](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/30/472147018/peking-ravioli-and-other-chinese-dishes-youll-only-find-in-boston)
4. We were raided by [raw0nline](https://www.twitch.tv/raw0nline)!
5. We raided [EroAxee](https://www.twitch.tv/eroaxee)

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] Make the visualization for the cuisine map (as in use something like tSNE to see where the recipes overlap in an unsupervised fashion)
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] Refactor the nlp preprocessing functions into their own script to import
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna
- [X] Change ad schedule, it's too many ads at once

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
