## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Talked about Pokemon Go Raids
   2. Talked about posting [dev environment blog article](https://buenosds.dev/2022/08/02/easy-data-science-windows-10-wsl-dev-environment-setup/)
      1. And how WSL is awesome
   3. Talked about posting photo blog article
2. Code
   1. We can try to fit a Decision Tree
      1. To visualize better is a little complicated, would require updating the virtual environment
         1. [Python Environment for Tree Exploration](http://etetoolkit.org/)
         2. [A few options for visualizing trees are listed in this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670280/tree-plotting-in-python)
      2. [Send Leah the math formulations for trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-mathematical-formulation)
   2. [Comparing classifiers inside sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_unveil_tree_structure.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-tree-plot-unveil-tree-structure-py)
   3. Variable name redeem:
      1. BREAD
   4. Unveiling the keyboard
      1. Took a break from code to show off the new [Keebio Iris board](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard) and swap keys over from the Redox
3. We raided [bedtimebear_808](https://www.twitch.tv/bedtimebear_808)

## To Do

### Code

- [X] Is there a cooldown on sound alerts?
  - There is a 60 second general cooldown on free sounds
  - User specific cooldown has been reduced to 5 seconds
- [X] Add github to twitch
- [X] add socials link(s) to chat bot commands
- [ ] change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] send [Leah](https://www.twitch.tv/LeahTCodes) the [math derivations for decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-mathematical-formulation)
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] Add tree visualization libraries to virtual environment: ETE or Graphviz (which is in sklearn now) or Plotly or treelib (which is the most simple)

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
