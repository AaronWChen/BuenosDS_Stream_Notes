## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Tried to get jupyter up and running before stream
      1. New error let's try to fix it
   2. R4D4R came in and gave a positive update on NLP project!

2. Discussion: [The Data Science Trap](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vtd6ln/the_data_science_trap/)
   1. Still questions on who determines needs and roles of data scientists
   2. It's fine to be jealous of the cutting edge research discussed on Twitter, but how much of that is actually done in industry vs what the business actually needs/wants
   3. [Rebuttal](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vtzw0b/the_data_science_trap_a_rebuttal/)

3. Wish there was better/controlled ad administration by streamer or mods

4. Code stuff
   1. Might have fixed Poetry dependency issues by manually adding some back dependencies (importlib_resources, zipp, importlib_metadata)
      1. This might have fixed VS Code, in addition to enabling JupyterLab
   2. While model fit/transformed, we looked at Pokemon
      1. [SLUGMA KUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvXocHmMKQc)
      2. [My next plush](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lechonk_(Pok%C3%A9mon))
   3. Totally forgot to add a `min_df` parameter to the CV
   4. Rediscovered task ideas from previous stream, can now do them next stream

## To Do

- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [X] Refactor pyLDAvis out because it is using deprecated features and we were only looking for the word groups anyway
