# How I Set Up My Windows 10/WSL Dev Environment

## Preparing Windows

Basic setup needs from [Microsoft docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)

Important things:

You need to have Windows Build 20262 or higher, and I think it's just easier to sign up for the stable Insider build. To check, go to Windows Settings -> Update & Security. To enable Insider builds, go to Windows Insider Program in Update & Security. You can pick which branch you want to be on, and I usually sign up for Release Preview although Beta Channel is usually pretty good. Release Preview is like a slightly faster version of non Insider

## Install WSL

After you've got the versions set up, you can install WSL (which defaults to Ubuntu, but you can pick an alternate distro). Open Powershell (maybe in Administrator mode)

And type

`wsl --install`

This may take a while and likely requires a reboot. After the reboot, I suggest opening WSL/Ubuntu and entering:

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get upgrade

    sudo apt-get install wget ca-certificates

## Install Winget and Terminal

After your computer is back up, go to the Windows App Store and install [App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4NNS1) or [Winget CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)

Use Winget in Powershell type

`winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`

or the [Microsoft App Store to get Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install).

Restart your shell after! That's as easy as closing Powershell and opening it back up.

## Configure Terminal to your liking

Use [these docs to customize Terminal's look](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-appearance)

By combining with [Windows Terminal Themes](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/). I like Doom Peacock, but obviously it's subjective and up to you! In fact I just switched to tokyonight but also thought about using DotGov =D

Basically, you open Terminal's Settings, open `settings.json` via the gear in the bottom left, add an entry for the color scheme (the easiest way is to copy/paste the theme from somewhere else like Windows Terminal Themes, and admittedly this is easier with VS Code), and then have your profile use that color scheme! You can make more tweaks to Terminal's appearance with those Microsoft docs, but I didn't bother.

## Install zsh

One advantage of using WSL is that you can now install zsh and especially [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/)

Install zsh in WSL:

`sudo apt-get install zsh`

Install Oh My Zsh in WSL:

`sh -c"$(curl -fsSLhttps://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

My preferred Oh My Zsh theme is [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) which you can install in WSL by typing:

`git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k`

Then editing your `~/.zshrc` with say

`nano ~/.zshrc`

and changing

`ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`

Heads up: Terminal out of the box might have ugly colors for directories. Doom Peacock and Powerlevel10k seemed to fix those for me, but otherwise you can try following the steps [here under Changing Directory Colors](https://blog.joaograssi.com/windows-subsystem-for-linux-with-oh-my-zsh-conemu/).

After you edit your `/.zshrc` you should also `source ~/.zshrc` in Terminal and maybe even close and re open it.

If you installed new fonts (like MesloLGS NF as recommended by Powerlevel10k), you should restart Terminal.

## Install VS Code

I prefer VS Code and [here are instructions on how to get it up and running with WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).

Briefly, you can install it from the [Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q), from the [installer on the homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or in Powershell Winget with

`winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`

Important: install the Remote Development extension pack! Otherwise, you will get oddities and reduced performance with VS Code when you're working inside WSL.

After you install VS Code, close and reopen your Terminal. This is to make sure VSCode gets added to your `PATH` and if you used winget to install, it's possible you may have to install it the normal way anyway. I used winget, didn't close Terminal, just ended up using the normal installer, and then restarting Terminal anyway.

Need to install GUI apps or use a GPU? You're beyond my experience/needs with WSL, and I suggest fully reading the docs from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-accelerated-training) and [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl).

In addition, there is a dedicated set of [docs for Troubleshooting WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting).

## Install ASDF

Ok, let's move on to [ASDF](asdf-vm.com), which lets you install multiple versions of a tool (like Python 3.8 and 3.10)

Open a Terminal instance of WSL and type the following (we need more packages)

    sudo apt install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev libncursesw5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev python-dev python-setuptools python-pip python-smbus libsqlite3-dev tk-dev openssl

    apt install curl git
    
    git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.10.0

Since we're using zsh, we can follow the relevant steps from ASDF's install guide:
Add the following to ~/.zshrc:

`. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh`

OR use a ZSH Framework plugin like [asdf for oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/asdf) which will source this script and setup completions.

Completions are configured by either a ZSH Framework asdf plugin or by adding the following to your .zshrc:

    # append completions to fpath
    fpath=(${ASDF_DIR}/completions $fpath)

    # initialise completions with ZSH's compinit
    autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

• if you are using a custom compinit setup, ensure compinit is below your sourcing of asdf.sh
• if you are using a custom compinit setup with a ZSH Framework, ensure compinit is below your sourcing of the framework

Restart shell with source

`source ~/.zshrc`

or opening a new tab!

## Install Python with ASDF

Now we can install Python

In Terminal

`asdf plugin add python`

Pick which version you want with

`asdf list all python`

And then install with

`asdf install python [version wanted]`

If you get module missing errors, you [may need to install some dependencies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27022373/python3-importerror-no-module-named-ctypes-when-using-value-from-module-mul/48045929#48045929). If so, go install the missing ones, then use asdf to uninstall the Python version you were trying to install (`asdf uninstall python [version]`), and then reinstall Python.

When Python is installed, set your version globally (`asdf global python [version]`), but also set your version locally in each repo if you would like (`asdf local python [version]`)

## Install Poetry

What version of Python do you want to use? It influences which method of Poetry install you need to follow
Introduction | Documentation | Poetry - Python dependency management and packaging made easy (python-poetry.org)

Or the Master branch Introduction | master | Documentation | Poetry - Python dependency management and packaging made easy (python-poetry.org) which is more modern and requires Python 3.7 or higher

Add autocompletion for Poetry!

    mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/poetry
    poetry completions zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/poetry/_poetry

You must then add poetry to your plugins array in ~/.zshrc:

    plugins
        poetry
        ...
        )

Get coding!
