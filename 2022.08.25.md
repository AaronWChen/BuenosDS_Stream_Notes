## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Talked about the ad schedule
   2. New schedule is 1 minute every 20 minutes
      1. Trying out the stream manager
      2. Tried to use the app, but there's a lack of feature parity, we'll try it this stream
   3. Went to Paris to see French architecture, and I got an *Eiffel*
   4. Keycap rant
2. Code stuff today
   1. Let's try to get tkinter working properly, as well as pickle
      1. For pickle/joblib
         1. We have to refactor the code cells from before
         2. Pickling needs classes to store custom functions, so the way we have it now, with a helper function in a code cell that gets imported does not work
         3. New scripts, likely requires kernel reboot
      2. For tkinter
         1. Might need Python reinstall?
         2. Restarting kernel didn't seem to fix the issue
         3. [Needed to install tk-dev](https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python/issues/50)
         4. Needed to reinstall Python 3.8.12 by just running `asdf uninstall python [version]` then `asdf install python [version]`
   2. What is AI vs ML?
      1. Would like applications of both that show actual differences
      2. Explanations seem to say some things but then blur together
      3. In some industries, it's just applications of known rules that are hard coded
      4. [Hong Kong MST uses an AI for scheduling](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329764-000-the-ai-boss-that-deploys-hong-kongs-subway-engineers/)
         1. [Actual paper from MST](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~hwchun/research/PDF/AsiaPacificRail.pdf)
   3. Pun-ish me daddy from Intelijens: bet
      1. intelijens: Why does the Dalai Lama go to Vegas? Tibet
      2. me: VCs are good at gambling because they've seen so many decks
   4. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), pretty sure it's used at work, would it help with our data engineering tasks
   5. [History of the rise of JSON](https://www.toptal.com/web/json-vs-xml-part-1)
3. We were raided by AppleGlass
   1. From AppleGlass, [Boil the Frog](http://boilthefrog.playlistmachinery.com/?src=Weezer&dest=Lady%20Gaga)
   2. Led to discussion on how researched removed the anonymity of large, sparse datasets
      1. [PDF of paper](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf)
      2. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105)
4. We were raided by earend
5. What about [pacmap](https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP) thanks hittaus
6. Beautiful [moon image](https://petapixel.com/2022/08/23/massive-174mp-moon-photo-took-two-photographers-two-years-to-make/)
7. Check out [Random Projections](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/random-projection-for-dimension-reduction-27d2ec7d40cd) and [here too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9qbuGSjzeE)
8. Maybe raid OpenSet someday

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] Make the visualization for the cuisine map (as in use something like tSNE to see where the recipes overlap in an unsupervised fashion)
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] Refactor the nlp preprocessing functions into their own script to import
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna
- [X] Change ad schedule, it's too many ads at once
- [ ] Check on the person who was asking for help with a JSON file containing weather data

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
