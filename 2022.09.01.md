## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Said i wasn't feelin too good
   2. We had a power outage
2. Coding
   1. Let's tSNE the whole training dataset!
   2. Hittaus has been super helpful
      1. https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText/wiki
      2. post-tsne kmeans labels plot per cluster
      3. pre-tsne HDBSCAN clustered plot per cluster
      4. Suggested [AgglomerativeClustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering) but the algorithm is O(N^3)

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [X] Make the visualization for the cuisine map (as in use something like tSNE to see where the recipes overlap in an unsupervised fashion)
  - Working on in iterative fashion
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [X] Check on the person who was asking for help with a JSON file containing weather data
- [ ] Get an electric kettle
