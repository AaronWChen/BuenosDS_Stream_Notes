## Summary

1. Intro
   1. How was your day?
   2. Miata is coming!
      1. Do I want to pick it up and drive back or ship it here
2. Coding
   1. Remember: we are refactoring today
   2. New feature: put the unlabeled/missing cuisine recipes inside the Kmeans pipeline and see where they all fall
3. From chat
   1. Variable redeem from ucelote: ILoveMyKeyboard.com
   2. From SpaceWarfareDevelopment: invited to an application that uses an AI to pull royalty-free open source music and adjust variations, to play in th ebackground of a creator's stream.
   3. [Programming YouTuber that disappeared =(](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevonCrawford)
   4. Brzetyslaww got a job!!!!
   5. Brzetyslaww asked a good question: when would a data analyst or data scientist want to use classes
      1. I think scripts containing callable functions are common and nice ways to package code
      2. Sometimes you may have to use a class to fit other architecture or libraries
      3. If you end up doing any sort of inheritance, classes are useful
      4. Scala or F# for functional programming languages
      5. Pola.rs might have the feel of functional programming with dataframes
      6. 
4. Break
   1. Read this post on [chance encounters](https://chan.co.za/how-fateful)
      1. Friend gave it to me asking if this is what love looks like for data scientists

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another look at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching
- [ ] Should .lock and tool-versions be added to .gitignore? I've never committed them
- [ ] Refactor to use Pola.rs
- [ ] Write better/more thorough docstrings
- [ ] Look up examples of applying OOP practices to data science

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
~~- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model~~
- [ ] Corno mode
- [ ] CuwonoZeewo scuffed mode
- [ ] Need a Klawful knife emote, or a shotgun (thanks R4D4R)
- [ ] Install minecraft
- [X] Check and commit from laptop
- [ ] Update suggested python dev list
