         1. Dratini Community Day Classic
         2. Gimmighoul reveal
      2. Took a nice drive
   2. Tidied up BuenosDS, and published a lot of notes
2. Coding
   1. Tried to finish migration from Heroku -> Render -> Digital Ocean
   2. Working on more feature agglomeration
   3. Possibly DBSCAN or HDBSCAN?
   4. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/66128/choosing-the-number-of-clusters-in-hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering
   5. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/361933/principal-component-analysis-and-dbscan
   6. Basically, we need to do dimension reduction regardless
      1. Let's try (for both Kmeans, DBSCAN)
         1. [] FeatureAgglomeration
         2. [] tSVD (again)
         3. [] NMF
   7. Let's install Optuna!
      1. Go through the tutorials and stuff, maybe we can work on this this week
   8. https://github.com/christopherjenness/DBCV instead of elbow method or silhouette analysis
      1. Installed via poetry+git!
3. From chat/derail
   1. stream_kyle's birthday tomorrow!
   2. Crono kinda wants melatonin
   3. From texoport
      1. [Dimension reduction!](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/361933/principal-component-analysis-and-dbscan)
      2. Add [button to copy links in markdown format in MeaLeon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)
   4. MeaLeon redeem for cochinita pibil (Mexican) because david_delaune asked waht we're working on
      1. [West Texas Stacked Enchiladas](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/west-texas-stacked-enchiladas-367410)

   5. dave_delaune knows someone who has a patent that reduced C/C++ code to AST to find plagiarism (sounds really cool)
      1. Charles Moyes (Microsoft -> NVIDIA -> Meta)
4. We raided EroAxee

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another look at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching
- [ ] Should .lock and tool-versions be added to .gitignore? I've never committed them
- [ ] Refactor to use Pola.rs
- [ ] Write better/more thorough docstrings
- [ ] Look up examples of applying OOP practices to data science
- [ ] Make a PR to update the documentation for how **kwargs are used for sklearn Pipeline (their example and docs are seemingly incorrect)
- [ ] Make a PR to update the FeatureAgglomeration docs to have linkage ward also say "only euclidean is accepted"
- [ ] Make a PR to update FeatureAgglomeration docs: cosine affinity cannot work with sparse matrices
- [ ] Figure out the ideal process for putting a corpus with collection of documents through a sklearn pipeline considering you previously got the overall counts and then did tfidf on the individual recipes using the CV from overall.

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
~~- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model~~
- [ ] Corno mode
- [ ] CuwonoZeewo scuffed mode
- [ ] Need a Klawful knife emote, or a shotgun (thanks R4D4R)
- [ ] Install minecraft
- [ ] Update suggested python dev list
  - [ ] Add statquest channel
- [ ] 2022.10.14 First ever follow bot attack
- [ ] Expensive redeem: crono tells lore from vtuber chat
- [ ] Add smort command
- [ ] Maweexy wants "Data Da Da", maybe that can be a different mode
  - [ ] Intelijens +1
- [ ] !Keyboard command
- [X] Really need to set up a timer for breaks/ads
  - [ ] Or just have fewer ads, Crono
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines to repo
- [ ] Use KMeans to predict cluster for the Missing Cuisine recipes
  - [ ] Move to rawer data (see step below)
- [ ] Run clustering on the untransformed dataframes to see what we get out
- [] Update README
- [] Check speed limiter on Edamam, it may be too restrictive
  - See if there's an error code to diagnose
- For next stream
  - Classify and or cluster the missing labels to see how they can augment existing recipe database
- [] 2022.10.31 Raided 4 times!
- [X] Migrate to DigitalOcean already
  - Flask app working in Dev!
  - Would like to make space on BuenosDS.dev/MeaLeon for it to run
- [] Add [button to copy links in markdown format in MeaLeon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)
