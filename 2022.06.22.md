   7. What is the origin of the term repository?
         From chat

            R4D4R_Live: In practice, however, a repository is generally a place for keeping objects or abstract things like knowledge, while a depository is a place for keeping money or other financial assets.

            SpaceWarfareDevelopment: Oh, I didn't know about the depository.

            fikotta: me2, and i do self identify as a wordcel

            SpaceWarfareDevelopment: So I have both a depository and a repository. Where does crypto fall in this ?

            SpaceWarfareDevelopment: abstract money. boom.

            R4D4R_Live: I guess general speaking, a repository is a place to store things that you regularly need access too

            fikotta: and i guess that github, doesnt blindly copy files, just symlinks them

            R4D4R_Live: whereas a depository is a place to store things for safekeeping without necessarily needing access

            fikotta: these songs are so short haha

            R4D4R_Live: seems like VCS just lifted the term straight from English and now we generally associated repositories with codebases

            fikotta: ohh yea, first that comes to mind, after dbs, for me is Medical stuff

            fikotta: repository of blood i thnk i heard, not my primary tho
