    7. What is the origin of the term repository?
       1. From chat
       2. R4D4R_Live: In practice, however, a repository is generally a place for keeping objects or abstract things like knowledge, while a depository is a place for keeping money or other financial assets.
SpaceWarfareDevelopment: Oh, I didn't know about the depository.
PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Yesterday by Elk Beats, Kayba & Lomme -> https://prtzl.io/PDHj4AXanadQevHm
fikotta: me2, and i do self identify as a wordcel
SpaceWarfareDevelopment: So I have both a depository and a repository. Where does crypto fall in this ?
SpaceWarfareDevelopment: abstract money. boom.
R4D4R_Live: I guess general speaking, a repository is a place to store things that you regularly need access too
fikotta: and i guess that github, doesnt blindly copy files, just symlinks them
R4D4R_Live: whereas a depository is a place to store things for safekeeping without necessarily needing access
PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Somewhere in the Clouds by Druid -> https://prtzl.io/W1Hb5xoOQEPj8Qsw
fikotta: these songs are so short haha
R4D4R_Live: seems like VCS just lifted the term straight from English and now we generally associated repositories with codebases
fikotta: ohh yea, first that comes to mind, after dbs, for me is Medical stuff
fikotta: repository of blood i thnk i heard, not my primary tho
