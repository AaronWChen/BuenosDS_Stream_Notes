## Summary

1. Intro
   1. We did a little clean up on previous stream notes
   2. Talked about the ice sphere thing i got from Target
2. Coding today
   1. Let's actually try to make a tSNE vis
      1. OpenTSNE with with default fitting is very fast, didn't crash on whole dataset. Accidentally put in the whole dataset instead of a sample and fitting only took like 90 seconds
      2. It worked, but the numerical indices needed for plotting don't make a lot of sense. This might be where Bokeh comes in
      3. Is there a way to remap strings back on for the legend?
      4. Rerun with whole dataset now that you know it's pretty fast
   2. Clip suggested using Bokeh with it for the hover overlays
3. What about using C for data science?
   1. I know C is under the hood for intensive calculations in Pandas and Numpy, but didn't know of actual C code being used
      1. There is a C++ library for machine learning called [Shark](http://image.diku.dk/shark/sphinx_pages/build/html/index.html)
4. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
   1. But check out [Al's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlSweigart/) for discount code
5. Variable redeem: cronozero_rocks from fantasysouhail
6. Maybe CornoZeewo can be the host for art streams and Crono can host data streams
   1. Has to be CornoZeewo uwu
   2. Uwu sound alert requested
7. Check out [glimesh](https://glimesh.tv/)
8. Raided by [AriaADM](https://www.twitch.tv/ariaadm)
9. Raided by [EroAxee](https://www.twitch.tv/eroaxee)
10. We raided [memmo_twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/memmo_twitch)

## To Do

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] Make the visualization for the cuisine map (as in use something like tSNE to see where the recipes overlap in an unsupervised fashion)
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [ ] Check on the person who was asking for help with a JSON file containing weather data
