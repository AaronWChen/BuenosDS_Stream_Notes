## To Do

- [ ] Move placement in Audio Mixer for Rode Mic
- [ ] Try support vector machine, decision tree, and ran
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
- [ ] Consider eventually switching to Hugo or Ghost for websites since you don't like Wordpress or Bluehost that much
