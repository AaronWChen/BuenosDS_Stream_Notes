## Summary

1. Intro for today
   1. Meetings all day
   2. Weather being nice and chilly
   3. Reminded myself to get a mosquito net/covering for the door

2. Linux mobile devices
   1. [UBports](https://ubports.com/)

3. Git Branching Strategy
   1. Honestly no real answer, just combinations of ideas
      1. Date? Name? Task? Jira ticket?
      2. Remember you can use slashes, underscores, and hyphens

4. Why do things like Git branching strategy and thorough documentation?
   1. I was told you do these to be nice to those who work async and in different locations from you. This includes yourself in the future

5. NoSQL vs SQL?
   1. Was cynically told "you will see NoSQL when the average age at the company is <25"
   2. I was also told (and slightly experienced) NoSQL is great for rapid deployment and development but stability and data integrity may be better with SQL
   3. R4D4R was saying that if you only need like one column, setting up the whole schema and writing functions/queries is a lot of work that maybe seems unnecessary

6. Ucelote redeemed pun-ish me daddy for food:
   1. "food pun sandwiched between code"
   2. "this truck is the taco the town"

7. Product rants
   1. My hair product smells a little like a vanilla aromatherapy candle
   2. I once, in grad school, to save money, used free body wash for a month or two and it definitely had body glitter in it but was free
      1. ucelote: a shiny Crono has appeared
   3. Chat gave me skincare suggestions
      1. R4D4R:
         1. Clinique for men
         2. Korean & Japanese beauty products in general
      2. Space:
         1. [Face foam cleanser "DE/OU"](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/rakuten24/e492914h/)
         2. [LUCIDO aging care milk oil control toner](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/kenkocom/e541491h/)

8. Went over the [certifications here in this list](https://albertchristopherr.medium.com/top-5-data-science-certifications-in-demand-by-fortune-500-firms-in-2022-362ad4e26b0f)
   1. I feel like i would recommend the Harvard one, the Azure one, maybe the IBM one, and the [Google Data Engineer one](https://cloud.google.com/training/data-engineering-and-analytics#data-engineer-learning-path)
   2. MIT one on EDX?
   3. [AWS also has training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/?cta=tctopbanner)

9. Cool languages
   1. Vspecky mentioned Haskell and FP
      1. Scala
   2. Rust
   3. Julia
   4. Nim
   5. Java
   6. JS

10. Did you know you can tab a username in Twitch chat and it autocompletes based on user list in your channel (thanks Pandapoopums!)

11. Raided by [LeahTCodes](https://www.twitch.tv/LeahTCodes)

12. Raided by [techygrrrl](https://www.twitch.tv/techgrrrl)

13. We raided [DirectiveAthena](https://www.twitch.tv/directiveathena)

14. Refactored the helper function into a Python script and then reformatted a lot to try to satisfy pylance. Also discovered with fikotta's help the oddities of how pandas objects are typed out (they seem to not be)
