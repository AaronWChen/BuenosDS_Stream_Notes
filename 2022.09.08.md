1. Intro
   1. It was really hot today
   2. Asked yuka about stream
   3. Mentioned work from home attire vs work at office attire
   4. Pizza
   5. Klawf
   6. Miata tease
   7. Career talk
      1. https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/x7hh75/anyone_else_noticing_job_postings_are_saying_ds/
      2. https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/x8ez7c/would_you_take_a_data_science_job_that_involved/
   8. https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
   9. R in VS Code
2. Intelijens did pun redeem for Cow
   1. "Did i tell one before? Does that mean i have to tell an udder one?"
   2. "are the cows still or are they mooving targets"
   3. cow and weed, best grass around, steaks too high
3. Coding
   1. After extensive search, realized that I needed to import an additional module into a jupyter notebook. Lesson learned: read the entire page of documentation before trying to follow along with first steps
   2. Visualization stuff
      1. Plot9 is like ggplot2 but in python form https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine
      2. Seaborn has [new objects interface](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/objects_interface.html) which looks nice to implement
         1. However, largely still static
      3. Consider Plotly instead of Bokeh
         1. Just looking for hover over of the non zero elements in the recipe's ingredient vector
4. Derailment

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [ ] Get an electric kettle
- [ ] Make a counter command for punny
  - [ ] Can make it a poll if possible, and just record results (good vs bad)
- [ ] Get [Klawf](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Klawf.png) in somehow
- [ ] Add new redeems
- [ ] Need a Klawf knife emote, or a shotgun (thanks R4D4R)
