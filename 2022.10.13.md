## Summary

1. Intro
   1. Webcam
   2. Work is much!
   3. How are your days?
2. Coding
   1. Deploying to Render
      1. For heroku users try these [migration instructions](https://render.com/docs/migrate-from-heroku)
   2. Going to refactor/test the refactoring
   3. Variable redeem from ucelote: ILoveMyKeyboard.com
   4. hittaus recommended [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
      1. There is a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) already called GitLens and I've been using it the whole time just without the graph view
3. From chat
   1. ucelote redeemed pun-ish me daddy for bootcamps
      1. When you go to a bootcamp you're expected to follow a specific code of conduct
   2. Launch School?
      1. Charges you for Core, then recommends Capstone. Both cost a lot...is that cost worth something over Odin or FreeCodeCamp?
      2. Otherwise, they seem mostly up front with costs and time involved, which is admirable
   3. Hittaus: [using 1950s tech in the age of big data](https://betterprogramming.pub/using-aws-and-hyperscan-to-match-regular-expressions-on-100gb-of-text-4d87a62141ee)

## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another look at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching
- [ ] Should .lock and tool-versions be added to .gitignore? I've never committed them
- [ ] Refactor to use Pola.rs
- [ ] Write better/more thorough docstrings
- [ ] Look up examples of applying OOP practices to data science
- [ ] Make a PR to update the documentation for how **kwargs are used for sklearn Pipeline (their example and docs are seemingly incorrect)
- [ ] Figure out the ideal process for putting a corpus with collection of documents through a sklearn pipeline considering you previously got the overall counts and then did tfidf on the individual recipes using the CV from overall.

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
