# Visiting Central/Western Massachusetts

## Disclosure

This article was written from my perspective and memories from living in Amherst, MA for 8 years during grad school. Some of these places may be closed or their visitation policies changed when you read this article. If you find out something is different, don't hesitate to let me know in the comments or by [contacting me](https://foco.photo/contact/) and I'll do my best to update accordingly!

## Why Visit?

This region of Massachusetts is famous for having beautiful fall foliage, the [Berkshires](https://berkshires.org/), several colleges, and the [Basketball Hall of Fame!](https://www.hoophall.com/)

## Intro and Planning

### Getting there

You have a few options for getting there! The closest airport is probably [Bradley in Connecticut](https://bradleyairport.com/) but it's a small airport. The nearest major one is likely [Boston Logan](https://www.massport.com/logan-airport/). [Peter Pan Bus](https://peterpanbus.com/) and [Greyhound](https://www.greyhound.com/en) both get out to Amherst, at least, but the region is best explored at your leisure so I strongly recommend renting a car.

### Where to stay

This highly depends on what you want to see! The network of roads going throughout this part of the state, as well as the relative sparseness and "city folk" impression of what it means to be "Western Massachusetts" means that you could be staying quite far from the places you actually want to go. 

Bostonians tend to refer to Worcester as Central Massachusetts and Amherst as Western Massachusetts, but if you look at the map, Amherst is basically exactly in the center of the state! If you were to go to Mt Greylock in the extreme northwest corner of Massachusetts in Adams, MA, it would take an hour and 40 minutes to drive from Amherst...which is basically the same amount of time to go from Amherst to Boston!

I would say that there used to be hubs of places to stay and visit.

1. Amherst and Northampton

2. Lenox and Great Barrington

3. Maybe Adams and North Adams

Why these areas? Well, Amherst and Northampton and their immediate surrounds are home to the [Five College Consortium of UMass Amherst, Amherst College, Hampshire College, Smith College, and Mount Holyoke College.](https://www.fivecolleges.edu/) These colleges likely are big reasons people go out here!

Lenox and Great Barrington are in the [Berkshires](https://berkshires.org/) in the furthest west part of the state. This area is pretty and romantic, and is the summer home of the Boston Pops. The Pops play in [Tanglewood](https://www.bso.org/tanglewood) during the summer!

### Things to See

Again, this depends on where you're staying!

If you're in the quaint Berkshires, the [Mass Museum of Contemporary Art](https://massmoca.org/) is super cool and North Adams has a cool feel and can be a good base for foliage viewing! It is also the western end of the [Mohawk Trail](http://www.mohawktrail.com/), which is an awesome drive. Of course, there is also hiking [Mount Greylock](https://www.mass.gov/locations/mount-greylock-state-reservation)!

South of that, Great Barrington has tasty food and coffee!
