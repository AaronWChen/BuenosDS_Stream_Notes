## To Do

### Code

- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile
- [ ] take another at streamlit
- [ ] Look up math theory behind t-SNE
- [ ] optuna for automated hyperparameter searching

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little

### General Stream/Admin

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Add new scene for 3rd monitor
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)
- [ ] CornoZeewo scuffed model
- [ ] Get an electric kettle
- [ ] Make a counter command for punny
  - [ ] Can make it a poll if possible, and just record results (good vs bad)
- [ ] Get [Klawf](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Klawf.png) in somehow
- [ ] Add new redeems
