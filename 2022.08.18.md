## To Do

### Code

- [ ] How to change wordpress endpoint, specifically /admin
- [X] send [Leah](https://www.twitch.tv/LeahTCodes) the [math derivations for decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-mathematical-formulation)
- [ ] Add custom function to look at the term frequency distributions
  - [ ] This is even what the scikit-learn docs do...they should just build it in to the algorithms...
- [ ] What is a good minimium document frequency for a term and what is a cutoff? 1/number of topics?
- [ ] Look at the [example on sklearn for NMF and topic extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda-py)
- [X] Add tree visualization libraries to virtual environment: ETE or Graphviz (which is in sklearn now) or Plotly or treelib (which is the most simple)
- [ ] Sery bot for follow botting protection
- [ ] Make hand cam a separate scene?
- [ ] Make a mealeon command
- [ ] How long is the variable name cooldown
- [ ] add ingredient information to search result box
- [ ] Make the background tile for MeaLeon so the gray doesn't take over
- [ ] Make the visualizion for the cuisine map
- [ ] Make subgoal buying a wet fart soundboard (thanks chat)

### Photo

- [ ] Try to see if the preview pane in Bridge can get shifted left a little
